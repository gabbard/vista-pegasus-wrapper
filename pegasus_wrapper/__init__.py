This modules provides a more functional wrapper around the Pegasus Python API.

Terminology
===========
- a *computation* is any sort of computation we wish to perform
    which is atomic from the point of view of the workflow engine.
    The canonical example of this is running a program or script on a cluster.
- a *workflow* is a composition of computations.
- a *value* is anything which is an input or output of a computation.
  For Pegasus, the canonical example of a value is a Pegasus `File`.
- a `DependencyNode` is an abstract object tied to a *computation*
    which can be used only for the purpose of indicating
    that one computation depends on the output of another computation.
- an `Artifact` is a pairing of a value together with one or more `DependencyNode`\ s.
